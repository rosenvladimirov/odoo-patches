# odoo-patches
Odoo is a wonderful project, but in the past has set the basis that there are fundamental flaws. In this project I tried to find and correct these errors. I think this change should be made in basic modules rather than fixes realizing additional modules to upgrade.
# fix - VAT price
The tax cost in most instances is equal to the market (the supply) price. With this amendment I added a choice of additional field of tax price. The latter compares with the market price and the calculated tax benefit on larger of the two. This requirement in one form or another exist in many countries.
# fix - Taxes
In calculating the taxes is quite niceties. This amendment is added ability to separate accounting articles about taxes than to charge duties. Clean the problems are internal Community transactions in the European Union. Clean the problems with the import and customs duties.
